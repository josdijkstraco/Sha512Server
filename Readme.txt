The server code is located in the ./Server directory. Build with 'go build server.go' in that directory.
There is unit test code in the ./Test directory. To run this, please build the server first in the ./Server directory.
Then, execute 'go test -test.v server_test.go' in the ./Test directory. All tests should pass.
